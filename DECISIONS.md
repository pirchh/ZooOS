# Initial decisions

Status: initial implementation defaults, with feasibility checks noted below.

## Settled for M0/M1

- Independent kernel, not a Windows or Linux kernel fork.
- Rust-first kernel, no_std and no_main; minimal architecture-specific assembly.
- Architecture: x86-64, one virtual CPU, UEFI; QEMU q35 machine, 512 MiB RAM.
- Kernel format: ELF for x86_64-unknown-none. Not a UEFI application pretending
  to be a kernel; execution must occur after firmware boot services have ended.
- Bootloader: bootloader crate 0.11.17 with matching bootloader_api 0.11.17 as the
  initial candidate. Confirm availability and compiler requirements in M0 before
  locking. A necessary version change must be documented with its reason.
- Firmware: OVMF/EDK II, separate code and per-run writable variable-store copy.
- Test execution: software CPU emulation as the portable default. Hardware
  acceleration can be optional, never required to reproduce the first boot.
- Logging: QEMU COM1 serial output, versioned startup and panic markers.
- Panic: abort semantics; report via serial, then halt. No unwinding or reboot.
- M1 memory ownership: consume the bootloader's documented BootInfo interface.
  Preserve bootloader mappings; no custom allocator or new page-table manager yet.
- Interrupts: keep disabled until deliberately implemented in M2. A halted M1
  guest is expected and must be terminated by the bounded host test harness.
- Host tooling: a small Cargo xtask program exposes build/run/verify commands.
  Do not require Bash on a Windows development host.

## Resolved in M0/M1 (2026-10-30)

Evidence for each item is in docs/verification.md.

- Toolchain: `nightly-2026-10-01` (rustc 1.101.0-nightly, 2026-09-30), pinned
  in rust-toolchain.toml with rust-src, llvm-tools, rustfmt, clippy and target
  x86_64-unknown-none. Nightly is needed only because bootloader 0.11.17's
  build script compiles its UEFI stage with `-Zbuild-std=core`. The kernel
  uses no unstable features and does not use build-std (x86_64-unknown-none
  ships a prebuilt `core`). The date was chosen as a recent nightly after the
  bootloader release (2026-07-27) and was confirmed by building and booting.
- Bootloader: bootloader 0.11.17 and bootloader_api 0.11.17, pinned with `=`.
  Only the `uefi` feature is enabled; the BIOS path is unused. Disk images are
  made with `bootloader::UefiBoot::create_disk_image` (GPT + FAT ESP).
- Host prerequisite: MSVC linker (already present). WSL and Bash are not
  required; all commands run from PowerShell.
- QEMU 11.1.0 installed with winget (user-approved system install). Firmware is
  the EDK II build bundled with it; see tools/firmware/README.md.
- QEMU machine: `-machine q35 -accel tcg -cpu qemu64 -smp 1 -m 512M`, firmware
  as two pflash drives (code read-only, per-run variable copy), `-nic none`
  (avoids PXE delays), `-display none`, `-monitor none`, `-no-reboot`.
- Serial: a small polled 16550 driver in the kernel (kernel/src/serial.rs)
  rather than an extra crate; port I/O asm is confined to kernel/src/cpu.rs.
  Waits for the UART are bounded.
- Normal and panic kernels are built with separate Cargo target directories
  (`target/kernel-normal`, `target/kernel-panic`) and image directories, and
  the panic kernel is selected by the `panic-test` Cargo feature. The kernel
  also prints `ORIGINS_OS INFO mode=…`, which the verifier checks, so a
  mixed-up image fails.
- The kernel prints an extra `ORIGINS_OS INFO` line with memory-map data from
  BootInfo. This is not part of the BUILD.md marker contract; it is evidence
  that kernel code ran with real boot data.
- Verifier: QEMU writes COM1 to a per-case file (`-chardev file`) and the
  harness polls it. Rules are in docs/verification.md. Negative cases: the
  panic image checked against normal expectations (must be rejected for a
  wrong marker) and the normal image with an extra marker that never appears
  (must be rejected by timeout, default 5 s).
- xtask parses its own arguments and uses only `bootloader` and `sha2` (for
  firmware checksums in doctor), to keep the dependency set small.

## M0 must resolve and record

(Resolved above; kept for reference.)

- Exact Rust release or dated nightly supported by the selected bootloader build
  path. Do not guess a version; test it and add rust-toolchain.toml.
- Exact required components and targets, and whether bootloader construction
  needs nightly or build-std. Limit unstable features to demonstrated needs.
- Host prerequisites, linker requirements and tested host OS. Windows PowerShell
  is the user's current environment; a Linux development host would not change
  the guest foundation, but do not silently make WSL mandatory.
- QEMU version, OVMF provenance, licensing, filenames and checksums. Resolve
  configuration through documented paths, not a developer's absolute paths.
- Exact image-generation procedure supported by the bootloader version.

## Deliberately deferred

Kernel structure beyond M1; scheduler policy; user executable format; persistent
filesystem; syscall ABI; IPC serialization; GPU and driver model; UI toolkit;
Windows compatibility host interface; model runtime and hardware acceleration.
Do not invent fixed addresses or public ABIs in this document before validating
the boot contract. Future memory maps must distinguish physical/virtual addresses,
reserved regions, guard pages, ownership and access permissions.

Before M3, document syscall numbering/versioning, handle lifetime, IPC errors,
process exit semantics and executable loading. Before exposing writable storage,
document crash recovery and filesystem consistency. Before loading device drivers,
document interrupt, DMA and ownership boundaries.
